                    <p>There are quite a few things you can do to help with clean and affordable energy and make it a reality. Donating and supporting charities and foundations that support renewable energy companies and work towards helping achieve the goal is something you can do
                        You can also push your provincial goverment or local community to switch to clean and renewable energy sources, you can educate yourself and others on
                        Goal 7 and try to spread the knowledge of how unclean energy destroys the planet, and the reality of how renewable energy can save the environment and the climate.

                <h2 id="title2">How you can help with Goal 14</h2>

                    <p>There are many things you can do yourself in everyday tasks to reduce water pollution. Use Less Plastic. It is very difficult to break down plastic after it is produced. Much of the plastic we consume ends up in the world’s water supply, where it is even harder to fish out and safely throw away.
                        Reuse Items. Whenever you buy something that is not recyclable, such as plastic, it is better to reuse this item as many times as possible. This habit limits your consumption and means less of those products will end up in the world’s rivers, lakes, and oceans.
                        Use Recyclable Options. If there are two options for a particular item, try to pick the one that is easily recyclable. Glass bottles are much better for the environment than plastic, for example.
                        And there are many more ways that you can help reduce water pollution.</p></div>

                <h2 id="title1">The Connection</h2>

                    <p>Conventional energy production is crucially dependent on abundant supplies of freshwater.

                        Thermoelectric water use—essentially, the boiling of water to turn turbines to make electricity or using water to cool power equipment—accounts for a stunning half of total water withdrawals in the United States. The vast majority of electricity generation comes from these steam driven turbines, whether one is using coal, natural gas, oil or nuclear fuel to heat the water.
                        
                        Once used, power plants release whatever water has not been lost to evaporation back into the environment at a much higher temperature, a practice which can seriously damage the ecosystems of waterways.
                        The quest for new sources of cheap, abundant energy threatens existing water sources.

We have known for years that reckless coal mining contaminates ground and surface water. We all know that coal is a dirty fuel, however; but what about “clean-buring” natural gas? Recent advances in hydraulic fracturing (hydrofracking) technology have created the potential for industry to exploit vast, previously untapped reserves of natural gas across the United States and the world.

But as the recent documentary Gasland showed, hydrofracking presents a serious risk to water, as the millions of gallons of water, sand and toxic chemicals it takes to frack a well seep to the surface, poisoning the ground and surface water of surrounding communities.

In Canada, meanwhile, the mining of oil sands has become a major source of “non-conventional” crude oil, touted as a way to offset declines in conventional oil production. But in addition to other problems, producing oil sands consumes tremendous amounts of water, mostly diverted from the Athabasca River.
