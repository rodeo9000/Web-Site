                <h2 id="title1">The Issue</h2>

                    <p>Can you imagine a world without oceans to swim in and explore? Oceans are home to seahorses, dolphins, whales, corals, and many other living creatures. Oceans are our planet’s life support as they provide water, food and help regulate the weather. Oceans also provide jobs for more than 3 billion people who depend on marine biodiversity for their livelihood. If we do not stop polluting our oceans, there will be severe problems that affect every person and living creature on the planet.Do you ever ask yourself where all the plastic bottles and bags go after you use them? Every year an estimated 5 to 12 million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean. Carbon emissions produced by human activities, like driving cars, are causing the oceans to warm and increase the acid level in the water.</p>

                <h2 id="title2">The Importance</h2>

                    <p>Coastal and marine resources contribute USD 28 trillion to the global economy every year. But this is only a small part of why they are so important to our planet. The world’s oceans – their temperature, chemistry, currents and life – drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind. Our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food, and even the oxygen in the air we breathe, are all ultimately provided and regulated by the sea. Throughout history, oceans and seas have been vital conduits for trade and transportation. Careful management of this essential global resource is a key feature of a sustainable future.            </div>

                    <p>Sustainable Development Goal 14 commits countries to unite over what is a truly global responsibility – the protection of our oceans and the lives that depend on it. By 2020, countries commit to achieving the sustainable management of marine ecosystems, and in another five years, significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds. This will require an international scientific partnership, regulation of harvesting and fishing, and enhance our research and knowledge on issues critical to the survival of life below water.
                        You can help by saving water, think about keeping the tap or shower on for a shorter amount of time. You can pick up trash or litter and throw it in the garbage, because these garbages and chemicals can flow into lakes and rivers when not taken care of. 
                        All of us need to help to protect our seas. You can suggest to your parents not to use plastic bottles at home, but use a filter instead, if your tap water allows. Next time you go to the beach, bring a reusable bag to collect garbage, so it does not enter the water.
                        There are many little things you can do in your everyday life to reduce water pollution and save the planet.

                <p>Water from lakes and rivers that are used by municipalities, agriculture, and industry, is increasingly exposed to pollutants from manufacturing or the environment.

                    Fertilizers can leak into rivers, and flooding leads to pollution of surface water as the volume spreads across areas that are normally not exposed to water. These contaminants are why water must be treated before being used for human consumption.</p>

                <p>Factories and sewage treatment plants are two common types of point sources. Factories, including oil refineries, pulp and paper mills, and chemical, electronics and automobile manufacturers, typically discharge one or more pollutants in their discharged waters (called effluents). Some factories discharge their effluents directly into a waterbody. Others treat it themselves before it is released, and still others send their wastes to sewage treatment plants for treatment.

                <p>Some wastewater, fertilizers, and sewage include high amounts of nutrients. If they are in water bodies, they help algae and weed to grow in the water bed. That makes the water non-potable and even blocks filters. Too many algae use all the oxygen in the body of water, and other aquatic organisms in the water will die due to oxygen starvation.</p>

                <p>on-point source pollution is contamination coming from dispersed sources. These sources include agricultural, stormwater runoff, and debris transported from land into waterways. Non-point source pollution is the foremost cause of water pollution in United States waters, but it is difficult to regulate because there is no single, identifiable origin.</p>

                <p>There are micro-organisms in the water bodies, aerobic and anaerobic organisms. When highly biodegradable objects that quickly decay are placed in the water, it stimulates more growth of micro-organisms, and they consume more oxygen in the water. When the oxygen is depleted, aerobic organisms begin to die, and anaerobic organisms grow more to create dangerous toxins like ammonia and sulfides.</p>

                <p>Interactions between surface water and groundwater are complicated. As a result, groundwater pollution or groundwater contamination cannot easily be categorized as surface water pollution. Due to their nature, groundwater bodies are sensitive to contaminants from resources that may not directly impact surface water bodies. The separation of point and non-point sources may be inappropriate in some cases.
