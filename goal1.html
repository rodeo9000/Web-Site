                <h2 id="title1">The Issue</h2>

                    <p>For many decades, fossil fuels such as coal, oil or gas
                    have been major sources of electricity production, third of the worlds population mostly women and
                    children will continue to be exposed to harmful household air pollution. But there is no development without fuelling the 
                    engine of growth. Energy is critical and people with no sustainable access to energy are deprived of the 
                    opportunity to become part of national and global progress. And yet, one billion people around the world 
                    live without access to energy. More than 781 million people in 2016, or 39% of the worlds population, do 
                    not have access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.
                    There is a large problem of both unclean and unaffordable energy in the current world.</p>

                <h2 id="title2">The Importance</h2>

                    <p>The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has said, “Energy is the golden thread that connects economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability. With access to energy, people can study, go to university, get a job, start a business and reach their full potential.” Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today security, climate change, food production, jobs or increasing incomes. Sustainable energy generates opportunity it transforms lives, economies and the planet. There are tangible health benefits to having access to electricity, and a demonstrable improvement in wellbeing. Energy access therefore constitutes a core component of the sustainable development agenda for energy. The production of useable energy can also be a source for climate change accounting for around 60% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.

                <h2 id="title1">How to Fix these Problems</h2>

                    <p>Countries can accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy system
                        by investing in renewable energy resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting
                        clean energy technologies and infrastructure. Businesses can maintain and protect ecosystems
                        and commit to sourcing 100% of operational electricity needs from renewable sources. Employers can reduce the internal demand for
                        transport by prioritizing telecommunications and incentivize less energy intensive modes such as
                        train travel over auto and air travel. Investors can invest more in sustainable
                        energy services, bringing new technologies to the market quickly from a diverse supplier base.
                        You can save electricity by plugging appliances into a power strip and
                        turning them off completely when not in use, including your computer. You can also bike, walk or
                        take public transport to reduce carbon emissions. To find out more about Goal #7 and

                <p>Geothermal resources are reservoirs of hot water that exist at varying temperatures and depths below the Earth's surface. Mile-or-more-deep wells can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that can be brought to the surface for use in a variety of applications, including electricity generation, direct use, and heating and cooling. In the United States, most geothermal reservoirs are located in the western states.</p>
